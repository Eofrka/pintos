---- RUN HELLO ----

>> Write a document about how the '$pintos run hello' works

1. Add hello.c, hello.ck into pintos/src/tests/threads directory.
   hello.c contains 'void test_hello(void)' which prints “hello, world!”.
   hello.ck contains the expected result of hello.c. (I refered other .ck file.) 
2. Add 'extern test_func test_hello;' in pintos/src/tests/threads/test.h and
   add '{"hello", test_hello},' to tests(struct test []) in pintos/src/tests/threads/test.c.
3. Finally add 'hello' to tests/threads_TESTS and
   add 'tests/threads_SRC += tests/threads/hello.c' in pintos/src/tests/threads/Make.tests.

   Adding just 'tests/threads_SRC += tests/threads/hello.c' can make running '$pintos run hello'.
   If I add 'hello' to tests/threads_TESTS, then I can check it with '$make tests/threads/hello.result'
   in pintos/src/threads/build directory.
