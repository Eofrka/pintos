FAIL tests/vm/mmap-overlap
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (mmap-overlap) begin
  (mmap-overlap) open "zeros" once
  (mmap-overlap) mmap "zeros"
  (mmap-overlap) open "zeros" again
  (mmap-overlap) try to mmap "zeros" again

Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (mmap-overlap) begin
  (mmap-overlap) open "zeros" once
  (mmap-overlap) mmap "zeros"
- (mmap-overlap) open "zeros" again
- (mmap-overlap) try to mmap "zeros" again
- (mmap-overlap) end

(Process exit codes are excluded for matching purposes.)
